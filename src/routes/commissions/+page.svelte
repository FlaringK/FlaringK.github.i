  I do portfolio static website commissions! Specifically <b>personal websites for individuals</b>. Just like the site you’re looking at right now! I’ve been making website and messing around with Javascript and CSS for about 5 years now, you can see examples of my work in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. <br>
  <br>
  This includes:
  <ul>
    <li>Creating and coding a multipage website using either svelte or HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
    <li>Helping find a free way to host your site online, using github or neocities.</li>
  </ul>
  This does <b>not</b> include:
  <ul>
    <li>Creating custom art or complex assets.</li>
    <li>Connecting your site to any sort of backend (No stores, comments sections or email services, though I can recommend some services if you would like.)</li>
    <li>Paying for a custom url domain or host.</li>
  </ul>
  Prices will fluctuate depending on the complexity of the site, but generally my rate is <b>$26 USD per hour</b>, and I will <b>charge for the first 3 hours up front</b> when starting a project. <br>
  <br>
  You can contact me by emailing <a href="mailto:caelans@iinet.net.au">caelans@iinet.net.au</a>, direct message me on discord at <b>@flaringk</b>, or message me on any of the sites in the <a href="/contact">Contact Me</a> tab.
